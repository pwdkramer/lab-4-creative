Vue/Node
For this lab, you will create a website that uses Vue for the front end and Node for the back end. The front end should use an API to communicate with the back end, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting data stored on the back end. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be similar to the Vue apps we have already built so far.

Pair Programming
You are welcome to use pair programming for this assignment. With pair programming,  two students work together at one workstation. One takes the role of the "driver" and writes code while the other takes the role of the "observer" to review each line of code as it is typed in and offer suggestions. The two students switch roles frequently during the project. The two students should have relatively equal levels of experience.

Pair programming is not assigning different parts of the project to two different people, and then meeting later to put the work together. You must follow the above guidelines for pair programming.

We have not provided pairings for this assignment, but you are welcome to use previous partners or anyone else in the class, from either section.

Requirements
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

The site uses Vue
The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account.

Submission
On Canvas, submit the URL for your website, which should be running on your DigitalOcean server. 
You will also be assigned 5 peer reviews in Canvas, after all the assignments are turned in. We will do these in class and also have demos.
Fill in this spreadsheet (TBD).
Rubric for Grading
We will grade your projects based on:

you used Vue for the front end,
you used Node for the back end,
you have an API that includes creating, reading, updating and deleting data on the back end,
how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.
TAs will assign scores in these ranges:

90-100: Excellent use of Vue and Node, clearly follows web design principles
80-90: Uses Vue and Node, good effort was made, but needs work to more clearly present the data or follow web design principles
70-80: Fulfills the minimum requirement of using Vue and Node, but does not make a strong effort to use it well or follow web design principles
